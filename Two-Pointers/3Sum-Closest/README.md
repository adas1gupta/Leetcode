# Leetcode 16 - 3Sum Closest (Medium)

**Topic**: Tree, BFS
**Link**: https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/description/

## Notes: 
 - Don't care about duplicates here
 - Don't get mixed up with using abs value and mistaking that to mean if the difference is < the target, we need to find a smaller value. 

## ðŸ§ª Code
See `solution.py`

## âœ… Time & Space
- Time: O(n) -> explore all the nodes. 
- Space: O(h) -> height of the tree is the amount of space stored for the call stack
