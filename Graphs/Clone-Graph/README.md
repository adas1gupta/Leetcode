# Leetcode 133 - Clone Graph (Medium)

**Topic**: Graphs, DFS 
**Link**: https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/description/

## Notes: 
 - The input is a reference to a node in a connected undirected graph. 
 - The goal is to create a deep copy of the graph
 - There are node objects that have:
    - Fields:
        - Val
        - Neighbors array
    - Constructor:
        - Default value for val is 0
        - Default value for neighbors is None
 - First, have a hashmap mapping the input nodes to the corresponding clones. 
 - Use a graph traversal algorithm like dfs. 
    - Take in a node because thatâ€™s what youâ€™re selecting to iterate past. 
    - The base case is that if a node already exists, then itâ€™s cloned, so return its clone. 
    - Create a clone of the node that youâ€™re on and enter it into the hashmap. 
    - Go through the neighbors of the node youâ€™re currently on, and append it to the cloneâ€™s neighbors field. 
        - What you append is the result of the dfs call on the neighbor node youâ€™re currently on in your iteration journey. 
    - Return the copy as that will be the answer/head of the new graph. 
 - return dfs(node) if node is not null and if it is, return None
