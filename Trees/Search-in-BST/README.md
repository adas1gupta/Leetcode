# Leetcode 700 - Search in a Binary Search Tree (Easy)

**Topic**: BFS
**Link**: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/description/

## Notes:
 - Just make sure to implement binary search here. 

 - This is O(h) time complexity, which is O(log n) and O(n) in worst case (skewed tree)

 
## 🧪 Code
See `solution.py`

## ✅ Time & Space

# Recursion
- Time: O(n) -> number of nodes. 
- Space: O(n) -> complete binary tree introduces worst case space complexity of a level to be n // 2.
