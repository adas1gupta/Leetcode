# Leetcode 100 - Same Tree (Easy)

**Topic**: Recursion
**Link**: https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/

## Notes:
 - Check if both p and q are None. If they are, then it's the base case, and you should return True because they're both None. 
 - Then, check if one of them is None and the other isn't. If that's the case, return False. 
 - Finally, return if p.val is equal to q.val and return the helper call on p.left and q.left and p.right and q.right.

## âœ… Time & Space

# Recursion
- Time: O(n) -> number of nodes. 
- Space: O(h) -> The call stack is O(h) because recursion goes down a path.
