# Leetcode 409 - Longest Palindrome (Easy)

**Topic**: Arrays & Hashing  
**Link**: https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/description/

## Notes: 
 - hashmap, valid anagram type of solution 
 - There's an important distinction that needs to be made with this problem. 
    - The space complexity is O(1) and not O(n) even though a hashmap is involved. 
 - There's also another alternative where you use an array to store 26 characters. 

## 🧪 Code

## ✅ Time & Space
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
