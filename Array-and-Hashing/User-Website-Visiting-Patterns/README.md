# Leetcode 1152 - Analyze User Website Visit Pattern (Medium)

**Topic**: Arrays & Hashing  
**Link**: https://leetcode.com/problems/analyze-user-website-visit-pattern/description/

## Notes: 
 - to generate combinations, use this code: 
    - from itertools import combinations
    - itertools.combinations(x, y)
    - it generates an iterator of tuples
    - it takes in an iterable and the length of the tuples you want to generate
    - the benefit of this is that it preserves the order of the iterable you give it
 - Just read through the problem. 
 - It requires sorting based on timestamp
 - It requires a set for the combinations you generate because a user for a pattern only counts once. 
    - MAKE SURE YOU'RE MINDFUL OF THIS SET REQUIREMENT!
 - It also wants the lexicographically smallest pattern if frequencies are equal.
