# Leetcode 380 - Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) (Medium)

**Topic**: Arrays & Hashing  
**Link**: https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/description/

## Notes: 
 - Think back to the Amazon interview. 
    - Grab a random number by using the range of the array boundaries (start - 0 && end - len(arr) - 1)
    - Then, use that random number to grab a random item from the array in O(1) time (self.arr[random_number])
    - If you want to remove items quickly from an array, swap what you want to remove to the end and pop (O(1) time)
 - Then, have the map store the index
 - This way, you can quickly check if a number is already present in the array in O(1) time.
