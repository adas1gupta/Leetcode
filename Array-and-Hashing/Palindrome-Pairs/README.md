# Leetcode 336 - Palindrome Pairs (Hard)

**Topic**: Arrays & Hashing  
**Link**: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs/description/

## Notes: 
 - key insight is that you want to go to each word and see what is missing from a word to make it a palindrome.
 - Basically, if you use lls as an example, "s" is something you can use, so is "ll", so is "lls", and "sl", and so on. 
 - This basically requires you to break down each word into a combination of two parts (looping through each word). 
 - Then, checking if the reverse of either part exists and if the other corresponding part is already a palindrome yields the other word that can be combined with the original word to form a palindrome. 
 - When you find something that works, simply make sure that it isn't the word that you're currently on.
